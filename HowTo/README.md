# You can modify this game yourself

## Making levels

Download ```levels``` directory and place it in
the directory you start game from.

Each level definition is a text file ```mapX.txt```. 
You can edit it with any text editor. One character is
one game field tile.

See ```levels/help.md``` for definitions.

## Changing game settings

There is a ```infoX.prop``` file that contains settings for
each level.

This file is optional.

See ```levels/help.md``` for more information.
